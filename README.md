# FMentor--stats-preview-card-component--challenge
My personal attempts on the challenge

I have no idea why there's a few pixels of distance between container border and an image. 
The width is set, height suppose to adjust to the content (as far as I know). All paddings and margins in conteners do not exceed image's height.
I could solve this with just fixing the height but nevertheless I want to know why this is happening - with that understanding I can learn better/more.
